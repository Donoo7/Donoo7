Hello there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px" height="25px">

I'm Sudhanshu Mishra, a 2022 graduate from IIITV. Currently, I'm working as a Full Stack Developer at [Solis.io](https://www.solis.io), where I've been contributing to the building and enhancement of [Solis.market](https://www.solis.market).

My expertise lies in using React and Ethers.js. Additionally, I have a wealth of experience working with Node.js and Solidity. Being in the tech industry has enabled me to refine my skills and consistently acquire new ones, ensuring that I remain at the forefront of my field.

Away from coding, I often immerse myself in competitive PC and mobile games, or you'll find me out on the cricket field.

As I continue my journey in the tech world, I'm eager to explore new technologies and expand my horizons.
